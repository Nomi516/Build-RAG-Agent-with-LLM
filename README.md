# Build-RAG-Agent-with-LLM
Build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Agent with LLMs (like OpenAI, Gemini) to answer context-aware, personalized queries from documents. Combine embeddings, vector spaces (via tools like Pinecone), and LLMs to retrieve data and generate accurate, grounded responses for real-world use cases.
